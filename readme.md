NemOS Ì†ΩÌ∫Ä
NemOS (Neil‚Äôs Modular Operating System) is a self-hosted, web-based dashboard designed to be a personal control center for IT workflows, automation, and creative exploration. It emphasizes a modular, private, and extensible environment for scripting, monitoring, and documentation.

The project's aesthetic is a cosmic control center meets a minimalist hacker theme, with a focus on a dark, keyboard-first interface.

‚ú® Core Features
NemOS is built around a series of powerful, independent modules:

Clipboard Hub: A persistent clipboard history with tagging, previews, and search capabilities.

Script Deck: Launch, schedule, and monitor your favorite scripts (AHK, Bash, PowerShell) from a central UI.

Container Control: A visual interface to manage Docker containers and Docker Compose stacks.

Markdown Vault: Your own personal wiki with support for Mermaid diagrams and syntax highlighting, versioned with Git.

System Monitor: View real-time CPU, RAM, disk, and network statistics with configurable alerts.

Network Toolkit: A suite of tools including an IP scanner, DNS lookup, and a traceroute visualizer.

Ì†ΩÌ¥ß Technical Stack
Frontend: A reactive, modular framework (Vue.js or Svelte) styled with Tailwind CSS.

Backend: A lightweight core server using Node.js or Python (Flask/FastAPI).

Database: SQLite for primary data storage, with optional Redis for caching.

Deployment: Containerized with Docker and Docker Compose for simple, modular deployment.

‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started on Ubuntu
These instructions assume you have git, docker, and docker-compose installed on your Ubuntu server.

Clone the repository:

git clone [https://github.com/your-username/nemos.git](https://github.com/your-username/nemos.git)
cd nemos

Configure the Environment:
The project uses a docker-compose.yml file for easy setup. You can customize ports and storage volumes by editing the settings.json file in the config directory.

Build and Run with Docker Compose:

docker-compose up --build -d

Access NemOS:
Once the containers are running, you can access the NemOS dashboard by navigating to http://your-server-ip:port in your web browser.

Ì†æÌ¥ù Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Our development workflow is as follows:

Define a module specification in Markdown.

Generate boilerplate code using AI tools like GitHub Copilot or Gemini.

Build the frontend UI component (Vue/Svelte).

Connect it to the backend API (Node/Python).

Test the module locally within its Docker container.

Document its usage, features, and any edge cases.
